The Woo Affiliates plugin allows anyone to make use of the WooThemes affiliates program by displaying a screenshot of a WooThemes theme, along with an optional short description, within a widget in their sidebar.

The WooThemes Affiliates Program is free for anyone to sign up to and is a few short clicks towards earning some extra cash with WordPress and WooThemes.
